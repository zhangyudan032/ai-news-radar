# AI News Radar

## First Reads

When this skill triggers inside the repo, read these files first:

- `skills/ai-news-radar/README.md` for the public-facing 伯乐Skill / Scout Skill positioning,
  source-intake prompt, and install-after-first-message guidance.
- `README.md` for project usage and current commands.
- `docs/GPT_HANDOFF.md` before release-readiness checks or handing the project
  to another agent.
- `docs/SOURCE_COVERAGE.md` before changing source strategy.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` before changing Source Overlap Check, story merge, or version
  planning.
- `docs/V2_PRODUCT_BRIEF.md` before changing product positioning or first-screen UX.
- `scripts/update_news.py` before changing data generation.
- `assets/app.js`, `assets/styles.css`, and `index.html` before changing the UI.
- `references/source-intake.md` when the user provides a new site, GitHub repo,
  RSS feed, newsletter, X source, or asks whether a source can be ingested.
- `references/v2-method.md` when the user asks for product optimization, source
  coverage strategy, Skill packaging, or "v2" direction.

## V2 Workflow

Use this order for non-trivial product or source-strategy work:

1. **Context pass**: read the current docs, source status, recent commits, and
   the smallest relevant code surface before proposing changes.
2. **Product diagnostic**: identify the user, current workaround, signal-density
   problem, narrowest useful default, and what must stay in the advanced layer.
3. **Coverage pass**: classify each requested source as official feed, OPML,
   public GitHub-generated feed, public archive, static page, X bridge, optional
   API adapter, or private inbox/bridge.
4. **Alternatives pass**: when the choice is not obvious, present 2-3 approaches:
   minimal viable, durable architecture, and optional creative/packaged variant.
5. **Implementation pass**: make small diffs, reuse existing fetcher/UI patterns,
   add tests for behavior changes, and run the fastest relevant validation.

For detailed prompts and decision criteria, read `references/v2-method.md`.

## Product Direction

Maintain a two-layer product:

- **Default layer**: a simple curated Signal view for ordinary AI enthusiasts.
- **Advanced layer**: custom OPML, source health, GitHub Actions, AgentMail email intelligence, and maintainer controls.

Avoid adding many reader-facing choices. Prefer better defaults, source quality,
and clearer status output.

The v2 packaging goal is a forkable public site plus a reusable agent Skill.
The public-facing Skill name is **伯乐Skill** in Chinese and **Scout Skill** in English. It should feel concrete and easy to use: a scout that helps choose high-signal sources worth tracking, instead of implying that the system knows everything or blindly adding every noisy feed.
Ordinary users should be able to browse the hosted page. Maintainers should be
able to add their own sources with OPML, public generated feeds, or secret-backed
optional adapters without changing the public default.

## Safety Rules

- Never commit private `feeds/follow.opml`.
- Never paste secrets, tokens, cookies, browser exports, or `.env` values into code or logs.
- Keep the public repo runnable without API keys.
- Prefer official RSS/Atom/OPML sources over fragile scraping.
- Avoid account-bound social timelines as defaults.
- Prefer reading public generated feeds over reimplementing another project's
  API or scraping pipeline.
- Treat X API, email, WeChat, private newsletters, and cookies as optional
  advanced integrations. Store credentials only in environment variables or
  GitHub Secrets.
- Treat AgentMail as a private advanced source, not a public default source.
  Never commit `AGENTMAIL_API_KEY`, `AGENTMAIL_INBOX_ID`, inbox addresses,
  full email bodies, raw emails, or private newsletter contents.
- Keep AgentMail disabled unless `EMAIL_DIGEST_ENABLED=1` and both required
  credentials are present. Only call the list-messages endpoint; do not call
  `/raw` or read `text`/`html` bodies.
- Do not publish `data/email-digest.json` to public Pages by default. Only allow
  publication when the maintainer explicitly sets `EMAIL_DIGEST_PUBLISH=1` and
  understands the site/repo privacy implications.

## Add Personal Sources

When the user has installed or forked the project but does not know how to start,
ask them for a source list first. A good kickoff prompt is:

```text
请使用伯乐Skill，先问我要信息源清单，然后帮我判断每个信源该用 RSS、OPML、公开 feed、静态页面、Jina 兜底、AgentMail 邮箱还是跳过。目标是部署一个不需要服务器、能用 GitHub Actions 自动更新的 AI 日报网站。不要把任何 API Key、cookies、token、真实 OPML、邮箱正文或私有邮件内容写入仓库。
```

Use OPML for private customization:

```bash
cp feeds/follow.example.opml feeds/follow.opml
python scripts/update_news.py --output-dir data --window-hours 24 --rss-opml feeds/follow.opml
```

For GitHub Actions deployment, base64 encode `feeds/follow.opml` and save it as
the repository secret `FOLLOW_OPML_B64` to override the public demo OPML. If the
secret is not configured, the workflow uses `feeds/follow.example.opml` as a
small public RSS/OPML demo so the hosted page shows the OPML path working. Do not
commit the private OPML file.
For AgentMail, use `EMAIL_DIGEST_ENABLED=1`, `AGENTMAIL_API_KEY`, and
`AGENTMAIL_INBOX_ID` only in environment variables or GitHub Secrets. Keep
`EMAIL_DIGEST_PUBLISH` unset unless the maintainer explicitly wants a private
Pages/repo to publish the metadata-only email digest.

## Evaluate A New Source

When a user gives a source URL, first classify it:

- RSS/Atom/OPML: add privately through `feeds/follow.opml` unless it should help
  every public visitor.
- GitHub project with generated feeds: inspect README, workflows, output files,
  and raw JSON/RSS URLs; prefer consuming its public feed files.
- Official changelog or static page: add a focused fetcher only if stable.
- Newsletter: prefer public archive RSS or archive pages. Use AgentMail only for
  private newsletter/product-update inboxes; keep it disabled by default and do
  not expose full bodies, raw emails, inbox ids, or private mailbox addresses.
- X/Twitter: prefer curated central feeds that already use official X API; direct
  X API should be optional and secret-backed.

For detailed intake checks and implementation patterns, read
`references/source-intake.md`.

## Add A Built-In Source

Only add a built-in source when it is useful to most public visitors.

0. Run Source Overlap Check for candidate RSS/Atom sources before promoting them
   into the public default layer:

   ```bash
   python scripts/evaluate_source_overlap.py \
     --source-url https://example.com/feed.xml \
     --source-name "Example Source" \
     --site-id example_candidate \
     --baseline data/archive.json \
     --lookback-days 7 \
     --output reports/source-intake/example-overlap.json
   ```

   Treat the report as advisory: low duplication supports `accept_default`, high
   duplication supports `skip_duplicate`, and small samples or medium duplication
   should stay `watchlist` / OPML advanced first.
1. Inspect existing fetchers in `scripts/update_news.py`.
2. Add `fetch_<source>(session, now)` returning `list[RawItem]`.
3. Use existing helpers for URL normalization, date parsing, and sessions.
4. Register the fetcher in the built-in task list.
5. Update `docs/SOURCE_COVERAGE.md` when coverage changes.
6. Add or update tests when behavior changes.
7. Run a local source-only probe before the full end-to-end generation.

## GitHub Project Feed Pattern

For repos like `follow-builders`, look for public files such as:

- `feed.json`, `feed-x.json`, `feed-blogs.json`, `latest.json`
- `state*.json` for dedupe behavior
- `.github/workflows/*.yml` for schedules, secrets, and output commit paths
- `config/*.json` for source lists

If the generated feed is public, stable, timestamped, and low-noise, add a
built-in fetcher that reads the raw GitHub URL. Do not copy its private tokens
or rebuild its crawler unless the user explicitly wants a self-hosted variant.

## Validate

Run the fastest relevant checks:

```bash
python -m py_compile scripts/update_news.py
python -m pytest -q
node --check assets/app.js
git diff --check
python "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/.system/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py" skills/ai-news-radar
```

For AgentMail changes, also verify default-off safety:

```bash
pytest -q tests/test_topic_filter.py -k agentmail
```

Confirm the checks cover: disabled AgentMail makes no network request, enabled
but missing credentials makes no network request, the adapter only uses the
list-messages endpoint, and email body/raw fields are not emitted.

When the Skill itself changes, validate the Skill package too:

```bash
python "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/.system/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py" skills/ai-news-radar
```

For an end-to-end local run:

```bash
python scripts/update_news.py --output-dir data --window-hours 24 --rss-opml feeds/follow.opml
python -m http.server 8080
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` and confirm the Signal view, all-source view,
WaytoAGI block, search, site filter, and source counts still work.

After pushing source changes, trigger and watch the workflow:

```bash
gh workflow run update-news.yml --repo LearnPrompt/ai-news-radar --ref master
gh run list --repo LearnPrompt/ai-news-radar --limit 5
```
